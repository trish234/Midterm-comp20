Midterm Project Postmortem
March 26, 2020


1.	Group Name & Members: 
  a.	Cozy Comp 20
  b.	Caleb Jeanniton, Trisha Cox, Zayyad Yunus, Asiyah Mumuney
  
  
2.	What Worked Well:
  a.	Our group handled working on our respective portions of the project well. We each were responsible for a couple of pages 
  on the website and each person delivered on their contribution. When it comes to the final, we think that a solid division 
  of labor will be important along with ensuring we each are involved in every aspect of the project.
  
  
3.	What Did Not Work Well:
  a.	The week leading up to the midterm project due date was busy for the majority of our team members. Given the demands
  that come along with managing multiple midterm projects and exams simultaneously, we were hard pressed to find meeting 
  times. This meant starting the bulk of the coding project a few days later than we would have liked. We hope to begin 
  much earlier for the final project.
  
  
4.	Group Ratings:
  a.	Time Management – 3
  b.	Project Management – 4
  c.	Communication – 4
  d.	Workload Distribution – 4
  e.	Team Member Support - 4
  
  
5.	Critical Item for Success:
  a.	We think that of the above items, communication is the most critical for the success of a project. In our specific 
  experience, it was difficult to find common times to meet face to face, so we decided to emphasize open communication. 
  This allowed us to be in different locations while still maintaining a clear understanding of our roles and deliverables.
  
  
6.	Group MVP:
  a.	We believe that Caleb was the MVP of the project because his early efforts helped us create the frame for the website.
