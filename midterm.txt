Info about the business:
  COZY Catering is a catering business that provides meal prep, event setup,
  food delivery, and clean up to its customers. This website will help them
  land more clients by giving potential clients a place to learn about
  their services and menu. They can also see positive reviews from other
  customers which will make them more likely to hire COZY Catering.

A section of code we're proud of:
  .homepage {background-image: url("LargeTableImage.jpeg"); height: 565px; opacity: 1.0; position: relative}
	.homepage:hover .overlay {opacity: 1.0}
	.overlay {transition: 0.5s ease; opacity: 0}
  
  We are particulary excited about the above lines of code because they enable a cool effect to take place when the user hovers over the image on the homepage. Essentially, the homepage appears to contain just a logo, navigation bar, and a nice image of catering. But upon hovering over the image, the user will reveal a message inviting them to check out the rest of our website and services. It's a small touch that we believe might intrigue potential customers.
